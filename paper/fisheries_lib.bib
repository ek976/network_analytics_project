	abstract = {Natural resource governance, and fisheries management in particular, includes multiple governmental jurisdictions and stakeholders. For many fisheries, however, an understanding of the numbers of organizations involved in management and the relationships among those organizations remains lacking. Using an email survey, we investigated the affiliation network of formal and informal relationships of Great Lakes Fishery Commission ({GLFC}) policy and decision makers (i.e., organizations involved in the management of Laurentian Great Lakes fisheries). The 63 respondents identified 1516 relationships with 149 organizations which provide numerous opportunities for groups to share resources and information. Important organizational roles that can be identified through network analysis include the coordinating role of the {GLFC}׳s staff and connections through stakeholder representatives. Informal relationships are an important aspect of the affiliation network with more than one-third of all relationships identified as informal relationships and 16 organizations identified only through informal relationships. Identification of affiliation networks could be a useful tool for understanding the connection between diverse stakeholder organizations and natural resource managers.},

	abstract = {Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated ({IUU}) fishing is recognised as a major threat to the health of the world’s oceans. In addition, the discourse around {IUU} is recognizing and recommending that {IUU} be viewed through the lens of transnational crime. Reducing {IUU} fishing therefore requires a detailed understanding of how fishing fleets function and interact transnationally. However, this is difficult to determine because {IUU} fishing is by nature a clandestine activity, and often occurs in contexts that, by intention, make monitoring very difficult. Disentangling fleet activities therefore necessitates identifying and understanding how key players or actors function to support or guide {IUU} activities. In this regard, recent efforts have focused on identifying transhipment activities by finding and following refrigerated cargo (reefer) vessels. We suggest that bunker (fuel) vessels, may provide one solution to understanding and unravelling these {IUU} networks for two main reasons: they are fewer in number, are known to provide additional support to fishing vessels beyond refuelling. In this respect, bunker vessels are also used to resupply provisions, and crew, thereby facilitating human trafficking and slavery, which is demonstrably rife in certain components of the commercial fishing realm (e.g., long distance or high seas fleets). Here, we illustrate how social network analysis could be used as a methodological lens to expose previously clandestine {IUU} fishing fleet dynamics. Specifically, we highlight the connectedness of a tanker vessel, and several fishing and reefer vessels, in an area in the Southern Indian Ocean that has high levels of fishing and general shipping.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have focused on the study of social networks among local resource users, but few have attempted to study co-management networks. The objective of the research was to assess the Chilean shellfish co-management system from an organizational network perspective. Starting with one detailed case study, representatives of 38 small-scale fisher associations from two administrative regions were interviewed to investigate: (1) networks of actors in each co-management case, (2) the functions of these actors in co-management, and (3) fisher perceptions about Chile's co-management arrangement. Results indicate that decision-making is highly centralized and power is concentrated in government, with little horizontal exchange and cooperation among fisher associations. However, the network approach indicates the presence of a rich set of players, some seven sets of actors by function. Grassroots management innovations are hampered by the existing co-management structure, suggesting that the system may benefit from a modification of the policy to allow greater learning-by-doing and flexibility.},

	abstract = {The management of the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) is a matter of international concern, as this species was a candidate for inclusion in lists for trade regulation. The major demand for its meat is from the European Union ({EU}) market, with the {US} and Canada as its two major contributors. The {US} has yet to support a spiny dogfish listing, although the {US} Atlantic stock is under a fishery management plan ({FMP}) that proved to be successful in providing a certified sustainable fishery. We employed a cumulative sum technique to compare trade data for frozen spiny dogfish export from {US} and Canada to the {EU} in relation to the {FMP} adoption. We also constructed a social network to visualize changes in the European trade scenario for spiny dogfish after adoption of the {FMP} and to predict future trade flow potentially affecting the conservation status of regional dogfish stocks in relation to recent management measures introduced in Europe. The social network analysis revealed that the exclusion of spiny dogfish from trade regulation lists eventually will affect the conservation status of dogfish stocks in Africa, Asia, South America, and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Our results suggest that the species listing would provide an economic benefit for the {US} Northwest Atlantic fishery, and will eventually foster the conservation status of other regional stocks worldwide and the search for a more sustainable global exploitation of spiny dogfish.},

	abstract = {Building a rich and informative model from raw data is a hard but valuable process with many applications. Ship routing and scheduling are two essential operations in the maritime industry that can save a lot of resources if they are optimally designed, but still, need a lot of information to be successful. Past and recent works in the field assume the availability of information such as the birth time-windows, cargo volumes, and container handling productivity at ports and cruising speed. They employ navigation maps that contain information about the major sailing paths and have knowledge about bigger or smaller ports and offshore platforms. In this work, we present a methodology for extracting information about the navigation network for an area, using data from the trajectories of multiple vessels, which are collected using the Automatic Identification System ({AIS}). We introduce a method for identifying the points of major interest to the trajectory of a vessel and two clustering techniques for identifying: i) key areas in the monitored region such as ports, platforms or areas where vessels change their course (e.g., capes); and ii) the speed and course patterns of ships of a particular type when they follow a typical route. The resulting information is modeled using a network abstraction where nodes correspond to the areas identified by the first clustering technique. After, edges are enriched with information about the groups extracted using the second clustering technique. The first analysis on a real dataset in the area of the eastern Mediterranean sea demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed model and the information it can provide. The use of the model in an outlier behavior detection task also shows interesting results.},

This study employs complex network analysis techniques to investigate the dynamics of Azores fisheries, using time series data converted into networks. We uncover associations between Tunas and specific islands, consistent links among fish classifications, and identify other pivotal nodes within the fishing network. Remarkably, nodes with high degrees and high betweenness centrality provide crucial insights into the fishing ecosystem. This study highlights the value of network analysis for understanding fisheries complexities and offers insights into sustainable management and the preservation of marine ecosystems. It also emphasizes the urgency for ongoing research and data collection to enrich our understanding of this multifaceted domain.},
